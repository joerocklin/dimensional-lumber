## Compost Bin

Inspired by designs from [Old World Garden Farms](https://oldworldgardenfarms.com/2019/06/06/diy-compost-bin/), this is a compost bin that can use either 2x6 or 2x4 stock. I needed to make these to fit into a smaller space, and based on pricing determined that 2x4 stock was a cheaper route to go.

| 2x4 Stock 36x31x33.75 | 2x6 Stock 36x36x36 |
